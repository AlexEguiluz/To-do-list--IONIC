# To Do app - Ionic
 Learning how to use Ionic
 
As part of my learning, I am discovering different frameworks and style sheets like Angular and Ionic. This week I have done some projects and exercises to familiarize myself with Ionic. In this particular one I have made a ToDO list app.:iphone: <br>
ToDo list --> You can add things to your list, number them and delete them once you are done with a simple swipe. <br>
Questions --> You can write and assign a color of preference to your text, add them elements to your list and delete them when you want. 

I will continue to explore and familiarize myself with this powerful tool. Let's see what else I can do...:eyes:
